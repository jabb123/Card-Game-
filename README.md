# Card-Game- My card game is going to be War. The goal in War is to win all of the cards in a deck. The two players draw a card from the top of the deck and the same time and compare the two. Aces are high and twos are low and the suits dont matter. if the drawn cards are the same there is a war. In a war the opposing players draw another two cards and compare the two, if one is higher the player wins the four cards, and if the numbers are they same again they draw another two and the winner take all of the cards at stake. A player wins when they accumulate all of the cards in a deck.
