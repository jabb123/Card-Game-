# Card-Game- My card game is war. the objective of the game is to get all
 of the cards in the deck there are two players who draw from a deck and 
compre the two crds, aces are high twos are low and suits dont matter.
 The two players split the deck then draw and compare the numbers.
 The player with the higher number takes both cards and adds them to his deck.
 If the cards are drawn and they are the same, there is a war.
 In a war the two players draw another set of cards and compare, and the 
winner takes all the four cards, a war can keep happening as long as 
the players keep drawig the same cards.
